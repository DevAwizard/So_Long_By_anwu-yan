# Essential C Libraries 

To use the functions open, close, read, write, malloc, free, perror, strerror, and exit in a C program, you'll typically include the following libraries:

`<fcntl.h>` - For the open function.
`<unistd.h>` - For read, close, and write functions.
`<stdlib.h>` - For malloc, free, and exit functions.
`<stdio.h>` - While not directly mentioned for the functions you've listed, it's commonly included for file and error output functions such as perror.
`<string.h>` - For strerror function, which gets the string representation of the current errno value.


Hereâ€™s how you might typically include these in your C source file:

```c
#include <fcntl.h>  // For open
#include <unistd.h> // For read, close, write
#include <stdlib.h> // For malloc, free, exit
#include <stdio.h>  // For perror
#include <string.h> // For strerror
```
